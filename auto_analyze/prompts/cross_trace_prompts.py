This is a {analysis_type} matching.
{analysis_description}

The goal of this step is to MATCH the operations between the median transformer blocks of all traces. 

Each trace has its own low-level GPU operations correlated to high-level operations, and since high-level operations as similar between traces (they all implement the same logical LLM transformer block), exploit this to help match the low-level operations between the transformer block traces.

Do the following:
- Read and analyze in-detail the high-level transformer block file of each framework
- Read and analyze in-detail the median transformer block file of each framework, with their low-level => high-level operation matchings.
- For each block, understand its operation sequence: the high level operation names, the low-level kernel names, and what each operation does.
- Match operations across blocks, one-by-one, with the help of:
    - High-level logical purpose
    - Order in the logical sequence of a transformer block
    - Source code inspections and deep dives
- Take into account separate GPU streams and their synchronization points.
- When operations do not match cleanly, perform a deeper analysis and source code deep-dive to fully understand it and fix it.

Produce a structured output with:
1. A matched operations table showing, for each logical operation, the corresponding high_level_op name, low-level kernel name, duration, and stream for each block — side by side.
2. Operations that exist in one trace but not the other (added/removed/fused differently).
3. Overall wall time for each trace.

Your task is to generate an improvement plan that fully recovers performance for ALL negative differences identified in [compare_file] from the perspective of the target trace.

Do the following:
- Read, analyze in-detail, and understand the comparison in [compare_file].
- Identify ALL cases where the target trace is slower than the other trace(s).
- For each such negative difference:
    - Understand in-detail the performance difference in the context of the high-level logical operation involved and the low-level operations produced.
    - Perform source code analysis to get all of the details necessary to understand the performance difference:
        - Do source code analysis for the faster framework, including call-chains and execution details.
        - Do source code analysis for the slower framework, including call-chains and execution details.
    - Understand in-detail the root cause, grounded in the source code and concrete precise reasons.
    - Understand in-detail why the other framework is faster and see how to fix this performance difference by porting the code from the other framework. I.e we want to COPY-PASTE as much as possible from the other framework while doing MINIMAL changes to the target framework.

- Generate a ranked improvement plan for the target trace that fully recovers its performance as follows:
    - Executive summary with gaps, key findings, key ideas, and ranked plan summary (that also has impact per each improvement in % of total block time).
    - A detailed ranked sequence of improvement proposals (from most impactful to less), where each proposal has:
        - A summary of root causes, key findings, key ideas, and estimated improvement/impact in % of total block time.
        - A step-by-step guide that describes how to port code from the other framework with minimal changes to the target framework, in order to fix the performance difference fully. For each step provide:
            - An explanation of the step
            - A code snippet example that shows what needs to be changed. Ensure the code snippet is properly formatted and detailed enough.
    - Make sure the plan is clear, concise and professional so that it can be executed on by a professional LLM programmer.
