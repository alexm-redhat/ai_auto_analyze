Read [run_params_file] to understand the analysis that was performed (model, GPU, execution parameters, frameworks involved).
Read [analysis_file] which contains the improvement proposals/plans.

The goal of this task is to create a set of JIRA tasks for each improvement proposal in [analysis_file]. Do the following and think hard:
- Use JIRA MCP for this task
- Analyze and understand in-depth the improvement proposals in [analysis_file]
- Verify that epyc <jira_epyc> exists. If it does not exist, then STOP and DO NOT continue this task.
- To represent the improvement proposals in JIRA, create a (master) task with sub-tasks, where each sub-task represents an individual improvement proposal.
    - Create a (master) task as follows:
        - The parent epyc of the master task must be <jira_epyc>.
        - The team value must be <jira_team_value>.
        - The activity type must be <jira_activity_type>.
        - Name the task using the model name, execution parameters, and a timestamp: tasks_for_[model]_[params]__TIME_[YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS]. Detect the parameters from [run_params_file].
        - Add a task description that describes:
            - High-level results of the improvement plan. Add important details to make it clear for both executives and programmers.
            - Info about the execution metadata from [run_params_file] (frameworks, GPU type, model, execution parameters).
            - Links to the analysis results in [results_dir].
        - For the links mention on what machine they reside: hostname and ip address.
    - For each specific improvement proposal, create a sub-task as follows:
        - The parent task is the master task from above.
        - The team value must be <jira_team_value>.
        - Name the task as: plan_[id]_[plan_topic] where [id] is the serial id and [plan_topic] is the topic.
        - Add a sub-task description that describes this specific plan. Make sure to include:
            - High-level description, including the general metrics of impact, difficulty and more.
            - Step-by-step guide with code snippets and maximum details per-step so that an expert programmer can execute on it (be consistent with what is inside [analysis_file])

- Make sure that all new JIRA tasks and sub-tasks created are completely new and are not overriding any existing tasks or sub-tasks. DO NOT modify anything existing in JIRA.
- Provide a summary of what was done and write it to [output_file].
