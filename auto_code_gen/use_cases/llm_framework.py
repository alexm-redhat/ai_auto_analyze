The goal of this task is to detect the <code_trace> inside <framework> that is active during the execution of <tested_execution> for improvement plan step <plan_step> (from <plan_file>). Think hard for this task and follow these guidelines:
- Analyze and understand in-detail the improvement plan step <plan_step> by inspecting all relevant files and data.
- Detect the <code_trace> inside <framework> that is relevant for improvement plan step <plan_step>.
    - Find all of the trace from higher levels to lower levels of the code
    - Go deep, into the kernel source codes if needed, including the C/C++/CUDA source codes of the kernel, and the associated C/C++/python wrappers, including any third-party libraries. Do not miss anything.
    - I.e find all of the relevant code pieces in the code that are relevant here and activated
- For the detected <code_trace>, perform a detailed analysis of how exactly the <code_trace> executes for the following iteration modes:
    - decode-only runs
    - prefill-only runs
    - a mix of prefill and decode runs
- Document each execution mode with its details, step-by-step from the high-level point of the <code_trace> to the lower-level point. Provide all critical details, which includes:
    - For each function in the trace, provide its goal, info, inputs (+shapes), and outputs (+shapes)
    - For the lowest level functions, inspect their source code in detail, and understand their inputs/outputs, including shapes and function assumptions.
    - Document classes/objects and their relations
    - Be professional, clear and consice, while documenting the trace gradually, in an incremental way from top to bottom.
- Document how cuda graphs affect each execution mode as well and how it is handled in the codebase

The goal of this task is to provide a high-level multi-step coding plan that implements the improvement plan step <plan_step> (from <plan_file>) inside "target" framework by porting <code_trace> parts from the "source" framework to "target" framework. Think hard for this task and follow these guidelines:
- Analyze and understand in-detail the <code_trace> of the "source" framework from <code_trace_files>.
- Analyze and understand in-detail the <code_trace> of the "target" framework from <code_trace_files>.
- Compare in-detail these 2 code traces step-by-step by traversing their code pieces via the associated call-chains.
- Detect <code_trace> parts of the "source" framework to port to "target" framework. Maximize the amount of code parts that are ported AS IS with MINIMAL necessary changes. Take into account the execution modes (and their effects on inputs/outputs/shapes and call-chains):
    - decode-only
    - prefill-only
    - mixed prefill and decode
    - For each execution mode above, trace fully input/outputs/shapes over various sizes of tokens, including edge cases, to see that everything looks good and makes total sense in terms of correctness.
- The goal of the porting process is to COPY-PASTE from the "source" framework AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. Keep things simple, and add only minimal code integration points that are actually required.
- Ensure maximal size parts are ported so that the integration points for each ported part are minimal in terms of code changes inside the "target" framework. I.e. prefer to port code as much as possible and not invent new code (to avoid potential new bugs).

- For each ported code part, ensure minimal changes to the part and minimal changes to the "target" framework.
- For each ported code part, if code adjustments are necessary due to "target" framework constraints, then try best to minimize these code adjustments as much as possible.
- For each ported code part, provide step-by-step integration coding details into "target" framework. Make sure to take care of decode-only, prefill-only and mix execution modes correctly.
- For each ported code part, provide porting idea documentation, with what is ported, why, what is unchanged, and what is changed, and why. Be clear, concise and professional.
- For any code part in "target" framework that is used here, ensure it is used correctly with the ported code parts.
    - Verify inputs/outputs for all execution modes: decode, prefill, and mix
    - Verify all constraints and dependencies

- For the porting process, if a faster kernel from the "source" framework is the reason for the speedups, then strictly follow these guidelines to copy-paste (vendor) the faster kernel to the "target" framework:
    - DO NOT import or use any of the <disallowed_modules>
    - Find faster kernel source codes on all levels:
        - The full C/C++/CUDA source code with the associated compilation/flags process.
        - C/C++/CUDA wrappers that are to propagate calls to the kernel.
    - Analyze and understand in-depth how kernels are implemented in the "target" framework and reuse this logic for the porting process of the faster kernel.
    - Copy-paste, vedor and re-implement this kernel in the "target" framework fully, including the C/C++/CUDA source code, compilation process, and its C/C++ and python wrappers. Make sure to copy-paste AS IS as much as possible to keep similar logic to the "source" framework.
    - If there is a similar kernel in the "target" framework already, then DO NOT REUSE IT. Instead, vendor and copy-paste the implementation as described above, since it is highly unlikely that the kernels are the same unless you can check the source codes and compare line by line.

- Ensure cuda graphs are handled properly for all execution modes
- Ensure the end-to-end multi-step plan is coherent, bug-free and works for all execution modes:
    - Sanity and verify shapes of inputs/outputs
    - Verify API usage is fully correct and coherent
    - Verify the lowest level parts are used correctly
    - Inspect and trace all of the necessary source code points that are sensitive.

- Ensure the new code in the "target" framework will run by default for the case that we care about.

- Provide risk analysis and potential sensitive breaking points

The goal of this task is to generate a code patch for the "target" framework that implements the coding plan in <code_port_plan_file> and the testing plan in <test_plan_file> (iteration {iteration}). Do the following and think hard:
- Analyze and understand in-detail the coding plan in <code_port_plan_file>
- Analyze and understand in-detail the testing plan in <test_plan_file>
- Implement the plans in <code_port_plan_file> and <test_plan_file> EXACTLY as they described:
    - Follow strictly the code and test plans as described, DO NOT DIVERGE.
    - If there is new (ported/vendored) C/C++/CUDA kernel code, then proceed on implementing the porting as planned, execute on it fully even it is really complex.
    - Recompile the "target" when there are changes to C/C++/CUDA codes. Ensure re-compilation succeeds, else iterate and fix until full success. Do not skip this step.
    - For recompile, USE INCREMENTAL compilation for the "target" by running the following commands (based on https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/contributing/incremental_build/):
        1. python tools/generate_cmake_presets.py --force-overwrite
        2. cmake --preset release
        3. cmake --build --preset release --target install
    - For recompile, use all available CPUs to make the process as fast as possible.
    - Avoid recompilation from scratch, and instead use the incremental compilation process described above.
    - Make sure to take into account all execution modes and verify their <code_trace> inputs/outputs/shapes for decode-only, prefill-only and mixed.
- Apply the new code patch to "target" framework inside <target_source_code_dir>, and if needed, fully re-compile the codebase.
- IMPORTANT: ALL code modifications (source code, tests, build files) MUST be made exclusively inside <target_source_code_dir>. Do NOT modify any files outside of this directory.
- Run all of the tests, do NOT SKIP anything, and make sure ALL TESTS ARE RUNNING AND PASSING (with the fully recompiled codebase if needed). If there are failures, then fix, revisit, rewrite, and re-run everything again.
- Ensure the code, both main code and test code, is written professionally, clearly, well-documented, and well-formatted, while taking into account how code is written in the "target" framework.
- Review your work critically and fix issues

Feature Toggle and Startup Verification:
- The generated code MUST include the following two mechanisms:
    1. STARTUP LOG: Add a log message that prints during "target" framework startup (e.g., during model initialization or engine startup) when the new feature is active. The message must follow the format:
       `<short_description_of_feature> is ENABLED`
       This log must appear in stdout/stderr so it can be detected in runtime logs.
    2. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE DISABLE SWITCH: Add an environment variable that, when set to "1", disables the new feature entirely and falls back to the original code paths. When disabled, print:
       `<short_description_of_feature> is DISABLED (env override)`
    - The env var name MUST be descriptive of the feature itself (e.g., `VLLM_DISABLE_PUSH_ALLREDUCE`, `VLLM_DISABLE_FUSED_MLA_ATTENTION`). It must NOT contain generic identifiers like "PLAN", "STEP", "AUTO_PERF", or numerical IDs.
    - Before choosing the name, search the codebase to make sure no existing environment variable with the same name already exists.
    - The env var check must happen early in the relevant code path (e.g., during model/layer initialization).
    - When the env var is NOT set or set to anything other than "1", the new feature runs by default.
</instructions>

<output>
- Dump the code patch to <output_dir>/{output_patch_file} (it must have both code and its tests inside)
- Dump a summary to <output_dir>/{output_summary_file} that includes:
    - An explanation of the code patch and tests generated in this iteration
    - A summary of the iteration evolution across all iterations up to and including iteration {iteration}, describing the progression of fixes and improvements
